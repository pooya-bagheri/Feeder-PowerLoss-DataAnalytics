The codes in this folder are intended to perform data analytics on relationship of power losses and voltages for test feeder. In fact, the objective is analysis of the data generated by my other project on GitHub [Feeder-PowerLoss-Simulation](https://github.com/pooya-bagheri/Feeder-PowerLoss-Simulation). The input data is from a relational database created by that project. 
<br>The analytics are performed in the Python Jupyter Notebook files and include exploratory data anlysis, dimension reduction, linear regression, feature engineering and neural networks.
<br>The methods and analytics in this project are indeed a simplified reflection of my PhD thesis research work: "Data-driven Assessment and Control of Smart Power Distribution Systems".
