The codes in this folder are intended to perform data analytics on relationship of power losses and voltages for test feeder. In fact, the objective is analysis of the data generated by the other project (Feeder-PowerLoss-Simulation). The input data is from a relational database created by that project. 
The analytics are performed in the Python Jupyter Notebook files.
